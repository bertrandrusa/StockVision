# Visualizing-and-Forecasting-Stocks-using-Dash
This project aims to provide a simple yet effective tool for stock market investors to visualize company stock data and make predictions based on machine learning models. The web application is built using the Dash framework, a Python library for building web applications with interactive user interfaces.
üî• Features:

üìà Real-Time Stock Data: Enter any stock ticker, and get up-to-date historical data, from daily price changes to advanced technical indicators.
üîÆ AI-Powered Forecasting: Powered by Support Vector Regression (SVR), StockVision AI predicts stock prices based on patterns and trends.
üé® Beautiful Interactive Graphs: Explore stock trends, moving averages, and future predictions using interactive graphs built with Plotly and Dash.
üß† Hyperparameter Tuning: The app automatically fine-tunes the AI model for optimal performance using GridSearchCV.
üöÄ How to Get Started
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/StockVision-AI.git
cd StockVision-AI
2. Install dependencies:
You'll need to install all the required packages before you get started. Simply run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Now, open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to start predicting and visualizing!

üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies:
Dash: Creates the interactive, user-friendly dashboard where users can visualize stock data and predictions.
Plotly: Powers the stunning, interactive graphs that allow you to explore stock trends in detail.
yFinance: Fetches real-time stock data for accurate visualizations.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): Uses AI to predict future stock prices based on past data trends.
GridSearchCV: Optimizes the SVR model by finding the best hyperparameters for maximum prediction accuracy.
üìä How It Works
Enter the Stock Ticker: Type in the ticker symbol of your favorite stock (e.g., AAPL for Apple, GOOG for Google) in the input field.
Select Date Range: Use the intuitive date picker to choose the time range for which you want to visualize historical data.
Explore the Graphs: Watch as StockVision AI displays a stunning interactive graph showing the stock's opening and closing prices.
Get AI Forecasts: The app trains an SVR model and forecasts the stock‚Äôs future prices over the next few days. Visualize the predictions with confidence bounds, thanks to the magic of machine learning.
üí° Key Features in Detail
Exponential Moving Average (EMA): Track stock price trends using EMA to smooth out price data.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): The app trains a robust AI model that predicts future stock prices based on past data. It fine-tunes the parameters of the model to achieve better accuracy!
Interactive Dashboard: Use the dropdown and date picker to customize the stock ticker and date range, and watch the graphs update in real-time.
üîß Advanced Features:
Hyperparameter Tuning: The app performs GridSearchCV to tune the SVR hyperparameters like C, epsilon, and gamma. This ensures the most accurate model for predicting stock prices.

Next 10-Day Prediction: Using the trained SVR model, the app predicts the next 10 days' stock closing prices and presents the results in an interactive graph.

Moving Average Visualization: The app computes the Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), allowing you to explore the stock's average trend.
