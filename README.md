## Visualizing-and-Forecasting-Stocks-using-Dash
This project aims to provide a simple yet effective tool for stock market investors to visualize company stock data and make predictions based on machine learning models. The web application is built using the Dash framework, a Python library for building web applications with interactive user interfaces.
# ðŸ”¥ Features:

ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Stock Data: Enter any stock ticker, and get up-to-date historical data, from daily price changes to advanced technical indicators.

ðŸ”® AI-Powered Forecasting: Powered by Support Vector Regression (SVR), StockVision AI predicts stock prices based on patterns and trends.

ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful Interactive Graphs: Explore stock trends, moving averages, and future predictions using interactive graphs built with Plotly and Dash.

ðŸ§  Hyperparameter Tuning: The app automatically fine-tunes the AI model for optimal performance using GridSearchCV.
